# assignment operators comprises of the following:
# =, +=, -=, /= and  %=.

# =: is used for assigning values to a variable
x = 5
y = 5
print("'=' is an assignment operator with a value of: ", x)

# +=: is used for incrementing the value of a variable by a defined value.
x += 5
print("The value of 'x' is incremented by 5, therefore x becomes: ", x)

# -=: is used for decreasing the value of a variable by a defined value.
x -= 3
print("The value of 'x' is decreased by 5, therefore the value becomes: ", x)

# /=: is used for dividing the value of a variable by a defined number.
x /= 2
print("The value of 'x' is further divided by 2, therefore the value becomes: ", x)

# %=: is used to further divide the value of a variable by a defined number.
x %= 2
print("The value of 'x' is further divided by the remainder, therefore the modulus becomes: ", x)

# **=: is used to get the exponential of a particular variable
y **= 5
print("The value of 'y' is raised to the power of 5, therefore, the result becomes: ", y)

# //=: is used to get the floor of a particular variable
y //= 2
print("The value of 'y' is floored to: ", y)

# would get a clear meaning of this.
y &= 2
print(y)
