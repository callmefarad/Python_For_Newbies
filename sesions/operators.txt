OPERATORS
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
There are 6 major sections of operators in python.
1. Arithmetic Operators
    - Addition(+): perform addition on values.
    - Subtraction(-): performs subtraction on values.
    - Multiplication(*): performs multiplication on values.
    - Division(/): performs divisions on values.
    - Modulus(%): is used to get the remainder value after a divisional operation.
    - Exponentiation(**): is used to raise a whole number to a particular power.
    - Floor Division(//): is used to get the integer part of values.

2. Assignment Operators
    - (=): used for assigning values to variables. [x=5 is same as x=5]
    - (+=): for performing increment to variable. [s+=5 is same as s=s+5]
    - (-=): for performing decrement to variable. [s-=5 is same as s=s-5]
    - (/=): for performing further division to a variable. [s/=5 is same as s=s/5]
    - (%=): for performing further modulus operation to a variable. [s%=5 is a s=s%5]
    - (**=): returns the exponential of a variable
    - (//=): returns the floor of a variable

3. Comparison Operators
    - Theses operators are used to compare two values and returns a boolean result.
    - Equal(==): checks for equality [s == y]
    - Not Equal(!=): check for non equality [s != y]
    - Greater Than(>): checks for truety or falsy and returns a boolean value [s > y]
    - Less Than(<): same as greater than.
    - Greater than or equal to(>=): returns true if any of the condition is true is true.
    - Less than or equal to(<=): same as above.
